		<description>
			<p>The origin of the sylvari is still unclear. What is known is that the Pale Tree was born of a fist-sized seed from a cave which Ronan, a human soldier, found. This cave was said to have been guarded by monstrous plant-creatures, though any details on them or the location of the tree is unknown, even to modern sylvari who have been looking for this cave since their race's birth from the Pale Tree.</p>
			<h4>CREATURES OF FLOWER AND BARK</h4>
			<p>The sylvari are omnivorous humanoid plants. Some sylvari closely resemble humans but with a fey cast to their features such as tilted eyes and pointed ear tips; most display plantlike features such as hard wood for bone structure, have foliage and petals for hair, and bark acting as flesh. They glow feintly during the night. Golden sap moves through their veins instead of blood and pollen falls off of them as they move. They are much more slender than the average human and about a head shorter. While sylvari can seemingly absorb sunlight and become rejuvenated, they still must eat and drink to survive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sylvari are usually honest, direct and focused, taking most things at face value. With the dream ensuring there is so much in common with the other sylvari, experience is cherished for creating uniqueness between them. They are eager to learn, experience and understand. Despite the kick start of knowledge from the dream they still seem naive as there are some matters which seem beyond their comprehension. Emotions and tact, in particular, are difficult for them to grasp, so often a sylvari will state out loud something which would normally be politely avoided by other races. Death too is not fully understood but viewed as something to be embraced and, as with many things in a sylvari's life, is viewed with a great degree of curiosity. These views serve to form an acceptance of and fascination with death that other races may find disturbing.</p>
			<p class="indent">As they are all born from the Pale Tree they could be considered all of the same family; however, their family bond is not as strong as most families, with many sylvari considering others more like distant relatives with few exceptions, such as twins born from the same pod or those who shared dreams, though the latter may also result in lovers. Romance is practiced among the sylvari, disregarding gender between those involved. To a sylvari, love is spiritual and eternal, regardless of physical form and contact, and sexuality is simply a natural part of life. So long as it is entered into with good will and joy, the gender doesn't make a difference. Sylvari can reproduce with other humanoid races as well. </p>
			<h4>SYLVARI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Sylvari names tend to follow these examples:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Male Names:</strong> Abhean, Cadeyrn, Dagonet, Diarmad, Itheann, Lachaidh, Kahedins, Malomedies, Melydiod, Pellan, Trahearne </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Female Names:</strong> Aife, Alainn, Amaryl, Benerla, Brigh, Brigit, Caithe, Cinea, Faolain, Geileis, Killeen, Meme, Morwyn, Muireall, Niamh, Noxia, Padra, Rhyn, Saeraquel, Vanus, Vella, Wisteri </p>
			<h4>SYLVARI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Sylvari characters have the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Age.</i></strong> Sylvari are mature at birth and do not experience age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Alignment.</i></strong> Sylvari can be any alignment, but tend towards neutrality and chaos. Sylvari of the Pale Tree are predominantly Good or Neutral, while Sylvari of the Nightmare Court are predominantly Evil or Neutral.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Size.</i></strong> Most Sylvari stand between 5 and 6 1/2 feet tall and are Medium creatures. As Sylvari are composed of plant matter, they tend to weigh slightly less than their size would indicate, and are buoyant in water.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Speed.</i></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Floral Biology.</i></strong> Owing to their plant-like origins, Sylvari have unique biologies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
				<li>You are immune to non-floral disease and poison.</li>
				<li>Your need to eat is halved provided spending at least six hours per day in sunlight.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to sleep, don’t suffer the effects of exhaustion due to lack of rest, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Rooting.</i></strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you are rooted to the ground and appear inert, but are not unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Wooden Flesh.</i></strong> Your flesh is made of wood and bark, which increases your base AC by 1. This added AC is ignored by Fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Languages.</i></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Subrace.</i></strong> As a Sylvari, the time of day you were born in determines your Cycle. Choose one of these subraces: Dawnborn, Noonborn, Duskborn, or Nightborn.</p>
